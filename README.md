*Thanks to the RevolutionUC Hackathon Organizers for such a great, productive time*

*NOTE*: The enhanced Hello Internet experience is now accessible at www.hellointernetbingo.com (well, it *was*. My partner in this project and I have no longer decided to fund the hosting of this site)
# Hello Internet
A web app devoted to making CGP Grey and Brady Haran's *Hello Internet* experience a good time 
## TODO
* Visualize HI podcast data from Itunes API
* Eventually have interactive Bingo for all Tims
* Add in Youtube API for embedded videos
* Add Rules
* Add Reddit source? Probably just to GitHub
* Use speech-to-text to get the text form of HI podcasts and analyze them
